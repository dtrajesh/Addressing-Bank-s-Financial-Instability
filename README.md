# Addressing-Bank-s-Financial-Instability

Bank is currently facing low financial stability due to two primary reasons: first, a significant number of loans are defaulting because the bank has been approving loans for customers who are unable to repay them. The approved loan amounts are not sustainable for these customers. Second, the bank is unable to estimate which actively paying customers will default in the future. To overcome these challenges and improve financial stability,  Bank has decided to utilize predictive analytics on historical data containing the loan progression data of 50,000 customers. This dataset has been preprocessed by aggregating data, removing null and zero values, and eliminating features based on domain knowledge modeling.
Classification models have been built to determine whether new customers will pay off their loans or default. Among all the models considered, the backward selection logistic regression has been chosen as the best model for this purpose. Additionally, a regression model has been developed to estimate the appropriate loan amount to offer new customers who are classified as likely to pay off their loans. The backward linear regression model has been identified as the best model for this task. Finally, another classification model has been built to predict whether ongoing customers will pay off their loans or default. The backward selection model has been deemed the best model for this analysis.
With these models,  Bank can offer appropriate loan amounts to new customers who are likely to pay off their loans, thereby reducing the risk of defaults. Moreover, the bank can identify which ongoing customers are at risk of defaulting, allowing for timely intervention to enhance financial stability.
